# SBT laucher evicts most memory-related JVM options and attempts to determine
# their values itself based on the amount of memory passed to the -mem option.
# The code cache size is set to 1/8 of the -mem value, resulting in 128M code
# cache for the default -mem value of 1024. This is not enough for a clean
# build, in which the code cache size grows to slightly over 200M. Setting the
# -mem option to 2048 gives us 256M of code cache.
-mem 2048
