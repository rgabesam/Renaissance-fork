It is not quite clear who owns what, life is tough sometimes. Anyway, all code
is released under an open source license which should make exact ownership
information irelevant. Git history could help indicating ownership, but history
can sometimes be modified.

Tracking Copyright Information
------------------------------

There is no copyright notice in any file of this project as this is an
imprecise solution that involves duplication of data. Git maintains a very
precise history of who changed what and when. This help a little bit, but
is not authoritative as well.

The copyright is not centralized to one party but is kept by each contributor.
Basically each committer owns each one of his commit to this repository. A
commit message can indicate that the commit has been done on behalf of a third
party, and will then attribute the contribution to the original author.

In order to simplify the licensing of the software, all code contributed to
this repository has to be released under the terms of the MIT licence. This
ensures maximal freedom for everybody in the use of the software.

BY COMMITTING TO THIS REPOSITORY, YOU ACCEPT TO RELEASE YOUR CODE UNDER
THE TERMS OF THE MIT LICENSE AS DESCRIBE IN THE LICENSE FILE.
